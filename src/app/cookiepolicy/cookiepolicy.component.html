        <p>Policy Summary</p>
        <p>This cookie policy explains how Nxtwave® Disruptive Technologies Private Limited (collectively referred to as “NxtWave®”, “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” in this cookie policy) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize the User (referred to as “User”, “you”) when you visit any of our websites</p>
        <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, NxtWave®) are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., such as advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
        <h3>Why does NxtWave® use cookies?</h3>
        <P>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our websites to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties place cookies on our website and are used for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</P>
        <h3>What types of cookies does NxtWave® use?</h3>
        <p><h4>Essential website cookies:</h4>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features. For example, they allow us to maintain secure login sessions. If you choose to refuse these cookies, then you may still use our website through your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.
        <p><h4>Performance and functionality cookies:</h4> These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to its use, for example, interaction with blogs, chat rooms and forums and to enable us to differentiate between customers and guest visitors for the purposes of determining the level of permitted use of certain tools made available via the website.
        <p><h4>Analytics and customization cookies:</h4> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.
        <p><h4>Targeting/Advertising cookies:</h4> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests and track advertising impressions. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously appearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, helping measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and, in some cases, selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
        <p><h4>Social networking cookies:</h4> These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our website through third-party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
        <p>When you share an article using a social media sharing button on our website (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter), the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.</p>
        <p>See the list below for the types of first and third-party cookies placed on our website and how you can refuse such cookies.</p>
        <h3>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h3>
        <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited our website. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one page within our website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of outbound marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
        <h3>Does NxtWave® allow targeted advertising?</h3>
        <p>Third parties may place cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by third parties using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or such third parties to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these (except that, as outlined above, we may combine certain information about your use of the website with personal information that you provide to us in online forms in order to contact you about products or services in which you may be interested).</p>
        <h3>How often will NxtWave® update this cookie policy?</h3>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated. Please revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>
        <h3>Where can I get further information?</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, then please email us at <a href="privacy@ccbp.in">privacy#ccbp.in</a></p>
        <p>In all cases, you can change your browser settings to refuse these cookies. Please visit browser’s help menu.</p>
        <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to refuse cookies. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may still use our website although your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.</p>
        <p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information. In addition, if you would like to find out more information about how to amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies, then please visit <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.</a></p>
